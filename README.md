OkGo
====

*OkGo* is [Cambridge University Space Flight](http://cusf.co.uk)'s
rocket firing controller.

*OkGo* was designed for testing the *Quasar* hybrid rocket motor.  It allowed
remote (over 100m of wire) control of the nitrous oxide valve and firing of the
ignition e-match.  It was constructed using an ad-hoc point-to-point layout.
An entirely passive design, it simply uses mechanical switches to trigger
relays.  It was later upgraded to control two valves, one of which passed a low
flow of nitrous oxide to help start the motor.

*OkGo 2* is a full redesign for the launch of *Martlet 2*.  Due to the
increased safety radius (on the order of 500m) radio control is to be used.  It
will have 4 general purpose (valve or e-match) channels with independent
continuity checking and firing, and separate firing boxes containing current
limiting resistors.
