Things to do
------------
Play with routing a bit and nail down pin assignments


Control 5V budget:
4x lightup button = 100mA
LCD = 150mA
total = 250mA
scale to 3v3: 337mA
30mA STM32
120mA RFM95W

Control battery wiring:
	Battery has JST-PH-F on short flying lead and sits on bottom half of case
	JST-PH-M Y-cable mounted on bottom half of case, to charge port on lower
	end-plate and to JST-PA on PCB.
	PCB routes battery via fuse to JST-PA for power button and then onwards.

Pin Assigning
-------------
PC13,14,15 cannot source current and only sink 3mA and are limited to 2MHz into 30pF

USART locations:

10: USART4_TX
11: USART4_RX

12: USART2_TX
13: USART2_RX

21: USART3_TX
22: USART3_RX

ADC locations: pin 10-19 inc


Casing and mechanics
---------------------

Hammond waterproof cases:
	Control: plastic watertight handheld
		LED board-mount flush into case with acrylic-caulk cover in cutout
	Ignition: plastic or hammond with shelves, wire-board everything
LCD mounting:
	Put it on the board with some tall standoffs so it sits just below the
	surface of the plastic case.  Cutout in plastic case replaced with clear
	acrylic, caulked and epoxied.
Coax/antennas: SMA-F on board either panel-mounted or lead to panel-mount SMA-F
