Firing cables
-------------
Banana jacks:
	Red: 1698956
	Yellow: 1698959
	Black: 1698957
Resistor:
	Need 2.5ohm with >60W handling
	RE03490 is 5ohm 50W for Â£1.5 - same as okgo1 I think.

Control 5V budget:
4x lightup button = 100mA
LCD = 150mA
total = 250mA

Control 3v3 budget:
30mA STM32
120mA RFM95W
337mA 5V budget scaled to 3v3
total = 487mA

Control battery wiring:
	Battery has JST-PH-F on short flying lead and sits on bottom half of case
	JST-PH-M Y-cable mounted on bottom half of case, to charge port on lower
	end-plate and to JST-PA on PCB.
	PCB routes battery via fuse to JST-PA for power button and then onwards.
