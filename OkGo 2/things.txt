pin name in backets means reset has different function
FT = 5V tolerant IO
FTf = 5V tol IO FM+ capable
TTa = 3v3 tolerant ADC
TC = 3v3

PC14/PC15 default to OSC32

PA0-3: TTa
PA8-12: FT


PB0-1: TTA
PB2: FT
PB10-12: FT
PB13-14: Ftf
PB15: FT

Maybe don't nail down SPI pins in STM schematic part, it's a bit weird.

Think about continuity checking -- ematches and valves.

Think about board to panel connectors.
