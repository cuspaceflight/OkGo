Casing and mechanics
---------------------

Hammond waterproof cases?
LCD: waterproof with a sheet of clear acrylic and caulk, possibly acrylic on inside, but likely outside of box cutout
For coax, put an SMA-F footprint on the board and that can either stick out of the box or go to a lead to panel mount SMA-F on the lid

control: maybe a plastic handheld watertight case.  awks to mount LCD waterproofly as always
nice and light tho

ignition end: metal box because explode
get a watertight light duty Al with mounting shelves and wire-board all the panel stuff

put LEDs on ignition end of testing, similar to current setup, 12V IP65 panel mount jobbies
LED colours!?

Channel ID with numbers or letters or colours or ???


battery charging
-----------------
control has a waterproof DC connector to its battery
ignition has an amphenol or similar lots-way waterproof connector connected to battery and balance

Adaptor cable from banana plugs (from balance charger) to waterproof DC thingy for control
adaptor cable from banana plugs and balance connectors to amphenol or similar thingy for ignition
