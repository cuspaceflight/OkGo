General structure: Control sends packets to Ignition at fixed intervals or in response to events.  Ignition actions the requests and replies with status information.  Control will send a low rate of poll packets when disarmed and increase the rate then armed.

Each Control packet will include a sequential identifier which Ignition will include in its reply, such that Control can tell if packets get lost.  Each Ignition reply also includes its observed RSSI so that Control can display both RSSIs in case of asymmetry (for example due to interference)

Status byte: Error/status (3 bits), Arm, CH4 fire, CH3 fire, CH2 fire, CH1 fire
CH1 cont byte (0-254 ohms, 255 indicates R>=255ohms)
Ch2 cont byte
Ch3 cont byte
CH4 cont byte
10-byte HMAC-MD5-80
