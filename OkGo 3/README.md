# OkGo 3
## Features
* Single channel
* Continuity measurement
* Constant current firing for e-matches (and talons)
* Built-in battery
* Charge from USB
* Small and light
* Maybe easily detachable BNC antennas?
* Config and firmware upgrade over USB?
* Firing current: How much does each e-match need? How many do I need to do
  simultaneously?  2 boosters with two matches in each?

## Parts
* Case: Hammond 1553WCBK and 1553WCGY (black and grey). Extra deep for ease and
  buccaneer fitting.
* Battery: Cool Components 157 or Farnell 2401856.  Farnell battery is max 2.2A
  discharge, where CC battery is 2C discharge or 4A.
* Battery management bq24232HA
* Antenna: RF00075 ? Because it'll be easily detachable? But you really want it
  to be VPOL. And it's gross to put the BNC on the top.  Maybe same pivot
  swivel as on OkGo 2 Ignition?
* Bulgin Buccaneer microusb female for comms/charging 252-438

## Thoughts
* Can I make both PCBs the same? They share the radio, battery, charging,
  on/off switch, case, USB, display, menu interface
* Differences is ignition has banana jacks, control has fire button and
  keyswitch.
* Board-mount antenna connector on one end and cable-mount USB on other end
* Board mount nana jacks on front face or on one end?
