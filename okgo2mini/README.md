# Design
* A mini version of OkGo 2 ignition, compatible with OkGo 2 control
* Use STM32F0 and RFM95W circuit from OkGo 2 ignition
    * If I'm careful I could make it pin-compatible and use the same firmware
      as OkGo 2, or just with minimal modification
* Use battery charge/management circuit from Toad/Linetime
    * Has only had minimal testing on Linetime. Wait for Toad to be tested
      before committing to this.
* Use 1A constant current firer from latest m3pyro
# Parts
* Nana plugs: red CN16308 black CN16305
* High retention red USB-B 1753809
